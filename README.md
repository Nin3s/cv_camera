# cv_camera
Camera program written using Python and OpenCV  
The purpose of this program is to be used with a Raspberry Pi in order to take photos during the NASA Student Launch competition.  

Do take a look at the [current issues](https://github.com/Nin3s/cv_camera/issues) to see what needs to be done (feel free to add more if needed as well)

## How to run it:
1. Install python on your system
2. Install opencv-python with the command `pip install opencv-python`
3. To run it, type in `python cam.py` into the terminal

## Button Inputs for Testing Purposes:
`space`: takes a photo  
`1`: toggle grayscale effect  
`2`: toggle 180 flip effect  
`q`: quits and closes the program  

## Requirements for NSL:
1. Add timestamp to photo
2. Change image to and from grayscale
3. Special effects filter
4. Pan camera at different angles
5. Be able to receive commands from radio signals
